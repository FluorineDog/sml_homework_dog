**NOTICE**
----------
To set up the environment correctly, execute *init.sh* and follow the instructions for the first time.

Then just modify "run" file into whatever you like based on my modification, then execute it via ./run

Or you may also follow the instructions on the PDF with the original *run*

Have fun!
